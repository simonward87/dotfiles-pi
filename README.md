# Raspberry Pi Dotfiles

I learned a ton about
[dotfiles, command line use, Homebrew, zsh, git, macOS and more with the course **_Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish_**](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz/)
by [@EIEIOxyz](https://twitter.com/EIEIOxyz/), and you can too!

## Restore Instructions

There are some assumptions about the Pi being configured:

- It is being setup in headless mode
- It has already had an image installed
- SSH has been initialised (placing an empty file named `ssh` in the root
  directory)
- WiFi has been setup (configuring `wpa_supplicant.conf` and placing in the root
  directory)
- You have successfully connected via SSH and are logged in

1. Copy local ssh id to the Pi. Consider adding an alias of the remote to `~/.ssh/config` for fast access

```sh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 USER@HOST
```

2. Update package info and install Git

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
```

3. Clone this repository. Use `https` for now, switch to `ssh` later

```sh
git clone https://github.com/simonward87/dotfiles-pi.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles
```

4. Confirm configuration details in `install.conf.yaml` and then run [`./install`](install)

### SSH Setup

1. [Generate ssh key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh),
   add to GitHub, and switch remotes.

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "39803787+simonward87@users.noreply.github.com"
```

2. Start `ssh-agent`, and then add the new key to the agent

```sh
eval $(ssh-agent)

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Create a config file in `~/.ssh` with `600` permissions

```sh
touch ~/.ssh/config && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

4. Add the new key so it is used for Github

```
Host github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

5. Make a copy of the public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) and add to Github >
   Settings > SSH and GPG keys
6. Test SSH connection, then verify fingerprint and username

```sh
# https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/testing-your-ssh-connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

7. Finally, navigate to `~/.dotfiles`, and set the remote to use SSH

```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:simonward87/dotfiles-pi.git
```

### Docker Setup

1. Uncomment the line below in `./install.conf` before running the install
   script (or just run the script directly)

```
# - command: ./scripts/setup_docker.zsh
```

### Desktop Setup (GNOME)

1. Uncomment the line below in `./install.conf` before running the install
   script (or just run the script directly)

```
# - command: ./scripts/setup_gnome.zsh
```

2. Run the desktop and login to get started

```sh
startx
```

3. Optionally, set the desktop environment to load on boot â€” run `raspi-config`,
   and then update the **boot / auto-login** settings to boot to desktop

```sh
sudo raspi-config
```

### WiFi SSH Dropouts

When connecting over SSH, the connection always drops after a period of time, necessitating a reboot. This can be fixed by turning off `power_save` in `/etc/rc.local`. Add the line below, before `exit 0` is called:

```
/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off
```

It can also be manually disabled using `sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off`, although this will not persist.

| Note: |
| :--- |
| `/usr/sbin` currently has to be manually added to `PATH` for `iw` to function, as it is not included by default |

### Root User Config

If desired, symlink local config (e.g. `.vimrc`) to the root user directory:

```
sudo ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vimrc /root/.vimrc
sudo ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zshrc /root/.zshrc
sudo rm /root/.bashrc && sudo ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bashrc /root/.bashrc
```
